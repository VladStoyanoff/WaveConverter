# WaveConverter
This project builds a converter that turns alpha and beta waves into words and sentences to the user's liking. It's intended to be coupled with good EEG hardware, so that one could communicate to a computer only by changing between concentrated and relaxed state. This projects will go over everything needed besides the EEG hardware (and 1 more amplifier, for which I will go in-depth later in this repository) so that this is possible.

This project took place over a timespan of 3 weeks and although I worked alone, I couldn't have finished it without the help of many great and kind people, which I will go in detail of how each person helped in the references at the bottom of the repository.
