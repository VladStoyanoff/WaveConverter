# Project Description
This project builds a converter that turns alpha and beta waves into words and sentences to the user's liking. It's intended to be coupled with good EEG hardware, so that one could communicate to a computer only by changing between concentrated and relaxed state. This repository will go over everything that I did in the process of building the converter.

This project took place over a timespan of 3 weeks, but given this step-by-step guide, I believe a novice in electronics and coding, could finish it in <= 3 days.
